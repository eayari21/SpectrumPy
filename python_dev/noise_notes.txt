Spectral analysis on real data:

- Take a fourier transform and add a random number generator to each phase
- Look at transfer functions of real electronics on the instrument
- See if there's some frequency component to add
- Look at "ringing" due to MCP electronics
- There are single ion signals, try to add those in intermittently (if we can find out what a single ion signal looks like)
- Take a look at very low frequency sources
- single ion signals would be small deltas
- Ringing will be obvious
- Can be due to too high of gain set on MCP detector
- Threshold trigger for ringing-like wiggles
